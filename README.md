# Learning resources for engineering managers
This document contains a collection of learning resources covering different aspects of an engineering manager's work.
I try to collect here ever-green resources that constitute a reference base helping me at my own work and making it easier to make recommendations to people that I talk to or work with.

The list is neither exhaustive nor static; it reflects my personal research and reading history.
